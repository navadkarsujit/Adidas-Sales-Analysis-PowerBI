# Adidas Sales Analysis Project

## Introduction
The Adidas Sales and Forecasting project aims to analyze historical sales data and develop a predictive model to forecast future sales. Leveraging Power BI, DAX, Power Query, and advanced analytical techniques, this project provides insights into sales trends, consumer preferences, geographic patterns, and more. By integrating a dashboard and forecasting capabilities, stakeholders can make informed decisions to optimize inventory, marketing strategies, and overall business operations.

## Problem Statement
The management seeks to understand sales patterns, identify key contributors to revenue, and predict future sales to enhance operational efficiency. The challenges include:
*	Analyzing historical sales data to uncover trends, peaks, and patterns.
*	Identifying top-performing products, retailers, and regions.
*	Understanding consumer preferences in terms of shipping, and product categories.
*	Developing an accurate sales forecasting model to predict future sales and plan accordingly.
## Process
* Data Cleaning and Transformation: The initial phase involved performing data cleaning tasks, including the removal of null values, the elimination of unnecessary columns, handling duplicates, and adjusting data types to ensure data quality.
* Data Modeling: The subsequent step was to create calculated measures and tables using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI, enhancing the dataset's analytical capabilities.
* Data Analysis: Following data modeling, an in-depth data analysis was conducted within Power BI, utilizing various visualization techniques like matrices to identify trends in sales, region-wise sales, category-wise sales, and other pertinent insights.
* Dashboard Creation: The project proceeded with the development of an interactive and dynamic dashboard in Power BI. This dashboard was allowing for seamless navigation between different charts and visualizations to provide a more comprehensive view of the data.
* Sales Forecasting: To deliver forward-looking insights, Power BI's advanced forecasting feature was utilized to perform a 15-day sales forecast. This forecasting capability assists stakeholders in anticipating future trends and making informed decisions.
